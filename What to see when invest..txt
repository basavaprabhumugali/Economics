1- Quality of managment team

 - Reliance , HUL, L&T, HDFC Bank are the leaders who stood test of time(to last a long time as strong high)

2- In bear markets , Look at P/E and P/B value , you should position yourself for big gains when market recovers and they will , though not necessarily in hurry.
    - conversely, stok trading at high PE multiplies could prove to be traps for no so savvy(verry knowledgeable) investors.
