				     1950-199			   

-  the goals of India’s five year plans
-  development policies in different sectors
-  merits and limitations of a regulated economy

Q- Every society has to answer three questions ?
Ans -
- What goods and services should be produced in the country? 
- How should the goods and services be produced? Should producers use more human labour or 
   more capital (machines) for producing things? 					 
- How should the goods and services be distributed among people? 

->> Their are two ttypes of society - capital society and  socialist society . Ans thoes Q's on based on these society.

- perspective plan- What is a Perspective Plan. Perspective planning is a blueprint regarding the objectives and targets of long run growth.
 The perspective plan is not just a plan, rather to attain certain objectives and targets; the perspective plan is divided into certain smaller plans. 
 
- FIVE YEAR PLAN -  growth, modernisation, self-reliance and equity

  AGRICULTURE 
- ‘High Yielding Variety’ (HYV)
- Land Tenure ->> In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to "hold" the 
land. It determines who can use land, for how long and under what conditions. Tenure may be based both on official laws 
and policies, and on informal customs. In other words, land tenure system implies a system according to which land is held 
by an individual or the actual tiller of the land. It determines the owners rights and responsibilities in connection with 
their holding.
- Land reform ->> (also agrarian reform, though that can have a broader meaning) involves the changing of laws, regulations 
or customs regarding land ownership. Land reform may consist of a government-initiated or government-backed property 
redistribution, generally of agricultural land.
 - Land ceiling ->>  This means fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual.
 The purpose of land ceiling was to reduce the concentration of land ownership in a few hands.
- The Green Revolution ->>:   the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds especially for wheat and rice.   The use of these seeds required the use of
fertiliser and pesticide in the correct quantities as well as regular supply of water; the application of these inputs in correct proportions is vital.
 (i) Ist phase (|960 - |970) use in  Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu .
 (ii) 2nd phase (|970 - |980) spreded to large number of states and yield many verity of crops .

                       -   a small-scale industrial unit was one which invested a maximum of rupees five lakh; at present the maximum investment allowed is rupees one crore. 
- Excise and custom duty ->> 
An excise, or excise tax, is any duty on manufactured goods that is levied at the moment of manufacture rather than at sale.
 Excises are often associated with customs duties (which are levied on pre-existing goods when they cross a designated
 border in a specific direction); customs are levied on goods that come into existence – as taxable items – 
 at the border, while excise is levied on goods that came into existence inland.

      CHAPTER - 4

			HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IN INDIA

- WHAT IS HUMAN CAPITAL?
 we need good human capital to produce other human capital (say, doctors, engineers...).   
This means that we need investment in human capital to produce more human capital out of human resources. 

-  SOURCES OF HUMAN CAPITAL
Education ,  health(healty labour), on- thejob training(), migration(expendeture on migration) 
and information(expendeture on knowing information of human market and other market) .

-  Physical and Human Capital
->> outcome depends on  conscious investment decisions.
->>  the physical capital formation is mainly an economic and technical process.
->>  Human capital formation is partly a social process and partly a conscious decision of the possessor of the human capital. 
->>  Physical capital is tangible(pridictable by touch) and can be easily sold in the market like any other commodity.
 Human capital is intangible; it is endogenously built in the body and mind of its owner .
->> both are depricated by times so needs to be updated .
->>  The physical capital is separable from its owner, whereas, human capital is inseparable from its owner. 
->> Nature of  both the capital are diffrent .  Human capital benefits not only the owner but also the society in general. This is called external benefit.
->> Human capital creates both private and social benefits, whereas physical capital creates only private benefit. 



- Pupil teacher ratio
The pupil/teacher ratio is an indicator of education quality. In crowded classrooms with a high number of pupils per teacher the quality of education suffers.
For pupils it is difficult to follow the course and teachers can dedicate less time to the needs of each individual student.


- World Bank, in its recent report, ‘India and the Knowledge Economy — Leveraging Strengths and Opportunities’, states that India should make a transition
to the knowledge economy and if it uses its knowledge as much as Ireland does (it is judged that Ireland uses its knowledge economy very effectively), then the per capita income of India will increase its income.

-  HUMAN CAPITAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

-  STATE OF HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IN INDIA
->> Do you know who takes care of education and health in India?
- the ministries of education at the union and state level, departments of education and various organisations like National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT),
 University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) facilitate institutions which come under the education sector. 
- ministries of health at the union and state level, departments of health and various organisations like Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) facilitate institutions which come under the health sector. 
ICMR - The Indian Council of Medical Research, the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research, is one of the oldest 
and largest medical research bodies in the world. The ICMR is funded by the Government of India through the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.


-  EDUCATION SECTOR IN INDIA
->>  expenditure by the government in education sector is expressed  in two ways (i) as a percentage of ‘total government expenditure’ (ii) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
- percentage of ‘education expenditure of GDP’ expresses how much of our income is being committed to the development of education in the country. 
Statistical concept and methodology: Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP) is calculated by dividing total government expenditure for all levels of education by the GDP, and multiplying by 100.
-Elementary education takes a major share of total education expenditure and the share of the higher/tertiary education (institutions of higher learning like colleges, polytechnics and universities) is the least. 
- Tapas Majumdar Committee, appointed by the Government of India in 1998, who decides how much to invest for education.
-  In 2009, the Government of India enacted the Right of Education Act to make free education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years. 
- Government of India has  also started levying a 2 per cent ‘education cess’ on all Union taxes. 
- The revenues from education cess has been earmarked for spending on elementary education. 
- Educational Achievements in India: Generally,  educational achievements in a country are indicated in terms of adult literacy level, primary education completion rate and youth literacy rate.

     CHAPTER 5
                       RURAL DEVELOPMENT

Credit and Markrting in Rural Areas
-  A major change occurred after 1969 when India adopted social banking and multiagency approach to adequately meet the needs of rural credit.
- National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was set up in 1982 as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions involved in the rural financing system. 
- The Green Revolution was a harbinger(showing direction) of major changes in the credit system as it led to the diversification of the portfolio of rural credit towards productionoriented lending.
- The institutional structure of rural banking today consists of a set of multi-agency institutions, namely, commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperatives and land development banks. 
-  The SHGs promote thrift in small proportions by a minimum contribution from each member.
- SHGs credit known as micro-credit programmes.


Agriculture Mareket System
-  The mechanism through which these goods reach different places depends on the market channels. 
-  Agricultural marketing is a process that involves the assembling, storage, processing, transportation, packaging, grading(maintaining the level) and distribution of different agricultural commodities across the country. 
- Issue - low market rate by traders to poor producer and lack of storage to sell produce after at better rate 
Majors taken -
i- regulation of markets to create orderly and transparent marketing conditions. 
ii- component is provision(providing) of physical infrastructure facilities like roads, railways, warehouses, godowns, cold storages and processing units. 
iii-  Cooperative marketing, in realising fair prices for farmers’ products .
iv- The fourth element is the policy instruments like -  
       (i) assurance of minimum support prices (MSP) for agricultural products 
       (ii) maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice by Food Corporation of India and 
       (iii) distribution of food grains and sugar through PDS.
MSP- Minimum Support Price is the price at which government purchases crops from the farmers, whatever may be the price for the crops. Minimum Support Price is an important part of India’s agricultural price policy.
 The MSP helps to incentivize the framers and thus ensures adequate food grains production in the country.


 DIVERSIFICATION INTO PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES
- Diversification includes two aspects one relates to change in cropping pattern and
 the other relates to a shift of workforce from agriculture to other allied activities (livestock, poultry, fisheries etc.) and non-agriculture sector. 
- Something non-farming yield other incomes to ppl
- Animal Husbandary ->> livestock production provides increased stability in income, food security, transport, fuel and nutrition for the family without disrupting other food-producing activities.
                     - Milk production  ->>  all the farmers can pool their milk produced according to different grading (based on quality) and the same is processed and marketed to urban centres through cooperatives. 
                                         - ex gujrat success story
-Fishing ->> 64% from inland and 36$ from marine sector(see ocean etc) , 0.91% contribution to GDP .

-Hoticulture- Flower harvesting, nursery maintenance, hybrid seed production and tissue culture, propagation of fruits and flowers and  food processing are highly remunerative employment options for women in rural areas. 
            - Root and tuber crops (Crop Groups 1 and 2) consist of root crops, such as beets and carrots, and tuber crops, such as potatoes and sweet potatoes, and the leaves of root crops, such as beet tops.
            - India has emerged as a world leader in producing a variety of fruits like mangoes, bananas, coconuts, cashew nuts and a number of spices and is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables. 
             -  growing of diverse horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, tuber crops, flowers, medicinal and aromatic plants, spices and plantation crops.
- Livestock is commonly defined as domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce labor and commodities such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, and wool. 


ORGANIC FARMING
- Organic agriculture is a whole system of farming that restores, maintains and enhances the ecological balance. 
-  Organic agriculture offers a means to substitute costlier agricultural inputs (such as HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers, pesticides etc.) with locally produced organic inputs that are cheaper and thereby generate good returns on investment. 


Notes- 
-  There is a greater need today to make rural areas more vibrant through diversification into dairying, poultry, fisheries, vegetables and fruits and
 linking up the rural production centres with the urban and foreign (export) markets to realise higher returns on the investments for the products. 



- List of All Revolutions:

• Black Revolution – Petroleum Production
• Blue Revolution – Fish Production
• Brown Revolution – Leather/non-conventional(India)/Cocoa production
• Golden Fibre Revolution – Jute Production
• Golden Revolution – Fruits/Overall Horticulture development/Honey Production
• Green Revolution – Food grains
• Grey Revolution – Fertilizer
• Pink Revolution – Onion production/Pharmaceutical (India) /Prawn production
• Red Revolution – Meat & Tomato Production
• Round Revolution – Potato
• Silver Fiber Revolution – Cotton
• Silver Revolution – Egg/Poultry Production
• White Revolution (In India: Operation Flood) – Milk/Dairy production
• Yellow Revolution – Oil Seeds production
• Evergreen Revolution – Overall development of Agriculture










            CHAPTER 7
                       EMPLOYMENT : GROWTH, INFORMALISATION AND OTHER ISSUES

-GNP - >> . When we also consider what we pay for our imports and get from our exports we find that there is a net earning for the
 country which may be positive (if we have exported more in value terms than imported) or 
negative (if imports exceeded exports in value terms) or zero (if exports and imports were of the same value).
When we add this earning (plus or minus) from foreign transactions, what we get is called the country’s gross national product for that year.  

- Those activities which contribute to the gross national product are called economic activities.
-  worker-population ratio for India, divide the total number of workers in India by the population in India and multiply it by 100,






         CHAPTER 8
                    INFRASTRUCTURE

    “Many things we need can wait, the child cannot. To him, we cannot say, ‘tomorrow’. His name is today.” 

- Punjab Haryana Himachal Pradesh - Agriculture and Hoticulture
- Maharastra and Gujrat -           Industries
- Kerla (God's own state)         - litracy , helath care and sanitation
- Karnataka                       - IT industries(MNC's)

- All these support structures, which facilitate development of a country, constitute its infrastructure .
- Infr. is for social and ecomonic development .
- It may lead to reduce morbidity or may increase morbidity(proneness to fall ill).

-India invest only 34% of GDP on infrastructure which is far less than china and Indonesia .

- SOURCE OF ENERGY
   - Commercial(brought and sold i.e coal, petrolenum , electricity) 74% of total energy used in INDIA is these and non- commercial(firewood , agriculture wate, cow dung) source of energy (26% used)
 
- Conventional source of energy- both comm. and non-comm. are conv. source of energy
-  non-conventional sources — solar energy, wind energy and tidal power . 

- ELECTRICITY generation- Thermal - 67% in elecricity generation
                        - hydel -  |2%
                        - nuclear  2%

- India’s energy policy encourages two energy sources — hydel and wind — as they do not rely on fossil fuel and, hence, avoid carbon emissions.
- Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and LED Bulbs 

HEALTH
-  The expansion of health infrastructure has resulted in the eradication of smallpox, guinea worms and the near eradication of polio and leprosy.
-  leaps and bounds
- private sector in India has grown independently without any major regulation; some private practitioners are not even registered doctors and are known as quacks.
-

Health sysytem in INDIA
-  made up of a three-tier system —primary, secondary and tertiary .
- Primary health care includes education on all aspect mdicin , prevention , idntifyining , food
-Primary Health Centres (PHC), Community Health Centres (CHC) and sub-centres .
-  When the condition of a patient is not managed by PHCs, they are referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals .
-  Hospitals which have better facilities for surgery, X-ray, Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) are called secondary health care institutions.
-  All those hospitals which have advanced level equipment and medicines and undertake all the complicated health problems, which could not be managed by primary and secondary hospitals, come under the tertiary sector. 
- Tertiary secotr ->>  All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi; Post Graduate Institute, Chandigarh; Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry; National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Kolkata.

   CHAPTER 9 
         ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

- Biotic and Abiotic 
- Renewable and non-renuwable 
-  Absorptive capacity means the ability of the environment to absorb degradation. 

A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared 
range. Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect on planets. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are 
water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone
- Some of the longer-term results of global warming are melting of polar ice with a resulting rise in sea level and coastal flooding; disruption of drinking water supplies dependent on snow melts; extinction of species as ecological niches disappear; more frequent tropical storms; and an increased incidence of tropical diseases. 
- global warming are the burning of coal and petroleum products (sources of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone); deforestation, which increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; methane gas released in animal waste; and increased cattle production, which contributes to deforestation, methane production, and use of fossil fuels. 

-  the rate of resource extraction was less than the rate of regeneration of these resources

-    Ozone Depletion



-  India alone accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the world’s total iron-ore reserves. Bauxite, copper, chromate, diamonds, gold, lead, lignite, manganese, zinc, uranium, etc. are also available in different parts of the country.

-  The threat to India’s environment poses a dichotomy—threat of poverty-induced environmental degradation and, at the same time, threat of pollution from affluence and a rapidly growing industrial sector.
 
- The Indo-Gangetic Plain, also known as the Indus-Ganga Plain and the North Indian River Plain.
- The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in western and southern India. It rises to 100 metres in the north, and to more than 1,000 metres in the south, forming a raised triangle within the south-pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent's coastline.
- Deccan Plateau is particularly suitable for cultivation of cotton, leading to concentration of textile industries in this region. 
- 

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
-  The concept of sustainable development was emphasised by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which defined it as: ‘Development that meets the need of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs’.
